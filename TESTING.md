## User Testing

We conducted user testing with friends and family to evaluate the site on their devices and gather real-world feedback from individuals who were not part of the site's development process.

Feedback from the users

* Users found it straightforward to create new tasks with titles, descriptions, dates, categories, and priorities.
* Deleting tasks was intuitive, and users found the confirmation prompt clear and helpful.
* Users found it effective to assign priorities (High, Medium, Low) to tasks for better organization.
* Registration and login processes were user-friendly, with clear password requirements and email validation.

# Accessibility Testing

## Lighthouse

Google Lighthouse test from the dev tools was used to test the pages on the site for 

* Performance
* Accessibility
* Best Practices
* SEO

# Known Bugs

## Resolved

I encountered an issue where no options were available to select in the category dropdown when attempting to create a new Todo item.

![Category error](documentation/testing-images/category-create-bugs.png "category error image")

After investigating, I discovered that the issue was due to missing category options in the database. I resolved this by manually adding category options using the Django shell. After adding the options, they became visible and selectable in the form, allowing users to choose a category when creating a Todo item.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Encountered difficulty when attempting to host the project on Heroku.

![Heroko-error](documentation/testing-images/heroku-bugs.png "heroku error")

Upon investigating using heroku logs --tail, it was discovered that the issue stemmed from a missing .gitignore file. After identifying this issue, I installed the gitignore package successfully. With the gitignore package installed, the project was hosted on Heroku without any further issues.
